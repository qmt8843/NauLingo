# NauLingo
This is a Discord bot that uses the disnake python library. The purpose of the bot is to translate English into Naumarian using regular expressions.
The bot makes use of a translator.py, which is the decendent of my other, poorly named, repo "translator". Along with being more complete, this bot is faster
because it makes better use of time complexitities bystoring the translations in a dictionary within a json.
<br />
Currently there is no reverse translation, but it is a top priority.
